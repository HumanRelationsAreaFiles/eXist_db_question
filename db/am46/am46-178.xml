					supporters, including foreign traders, speculators, and the few extant
					landlords, fled Laos immediately before or immediately after the communist
					takeover. But a significant number stayed, though not for long. One of the new
					government's first actions was to place restrictions on the activities of
					“capitalists” and “class enemies,” namely, the merchants. Their ability to
					import was severely curtailed; they were prohibited from buying rice and
					livestock and from conducting interprovincial trade. Restrictions on
					intermittent peasant commerce and petty traders spilled over from this policy.
					Unfortunately for the new regime there were no socialist trading organizations
					to take the place of existing traders. Consequently a substantial decline in
					internal commerce occurred and quickly forced the peasant communities to retreat
					to their previous high levels of self-sufficiency. Handlooms packed away many
					years before when foreign imports became available were reassembled under
					houses; evenings lengthened as villages drifted into darkness following the
					drying up of fuel supplies for lamps. A currency change in June 1976 from the
					old kip to the “liberation” kip reignited not-long-dormant peasant suspicions of
					paper money and led to a resurgence of barter exchanges.<page.break pg.no="67" xml:id="am46-178-00083"/><culture.change xml:id="am46-178-00084" pageEid="am46-178-00083"><culture xml:id="am46-178-00085"><region xml:id="am46-178-00086">Southeast Asia</region><name xml:id="am46-178-00087">Lao</name><owc xml:id="am46-178-00088">AM46</owc></culture><place type="coverage" xml:id="am46-178-00089">Vientiane Province, Laos</place><date type="coverage" xml:id="am46-178-00090">1967 AD - 1985 AD</date></culture.change> In its battle with inflation the government tried

					life.</p><p xml:id="am46-178-00091" ocms="458 465 464 369 423 432 433" pageEid="am46-178-00083">Some evidence suggests that a
					spontaneous “land reform” took place in the peasant communities. The depression
					of the urban economy following the communist takeover had a number of
					consequences for the peasants in the districts surrounding Vientiane and other
					urban centers. Generally it meant fewer opportunities for earning occasional
					cash income through some form of employment in the cities. The contraction of
					the urban economy also modified the viability of smaller landholdings. But the
					job market was not the only element to contract: wages and salaries plummeted.
					The government admitted that its salary scales were very low and lagged well
					behind inflation. In this situation earnings from the land became increasingly
					important. One response was a certain “peasantising” of the city as the
					government urged the urban population to grow its own food and ministries were
					instructed to establish gardens for their employees. Rather than commerce
					fanning out into the countryside, the natural economy began making inroads into
					the urban areas. But the contraction of the urban economy also led to a reflux
					of labor back into the countryside, and land rights back in the villages were
					reactivated. As a result, some families experienced a serious strain on
					resources, while others—those who held larger parcels of land (five hectares or
					more)—either sold off portions of it or prematurely dispersed it in fear that if
					they did not do so they would be accused of landlordism and have their land
					confiscated. One effect of the revolution, therefore, appears to have been a
					spontaneous, egalitarian “land reform” without any government intervention
					whatsoever.</p><p xml:id="am46-178-00092" ocms="621 131 592 423" pageEid="am46-178-00083">Evidence for this claim is found

					into the same categories we get 70 percent of holdings below 1.5ha, 26.4 percent
					between 1.5ha and 3.5ha, and 3.2 percent above 3.5ha, In tasseng Bo-O there are
					few large holdings compared with those on the Vientiane Plain in general prior
					to 1975, many more smaller holdings, and relatively fewer middle holdings. The
					area Casier Sud provides a point of comparison because it is in the same muang
					as tasseng Bo-O: holdings above 3.5ha are roughly the same in both areas, but in
					Bo-O the number of holdings below 1.5ha is significantly higher than in Casier
					Sud. The figures indicate a general downward distribution of land with more

					activity for Lao peasants—even for those with insufficient land in densely
					settled areas. It is important in muang Hatsayfong because the main abattoir
					serving Vientiane is located there. Until January 1985 the abattoir was run by
					the state-controlled Society of Foodstuffs, which bought animals to be sold as
					meat in the state shop system. The society accounted for only about 10 percent
					of the output at the abattoir, the rest being taken up by private traders and
					middlemen occupying different positions in the marketing network. This network
					illegally traded into Thailand as much as 15 percent of the cattle and buffalo
					that came onto the Vientiane provincial market. In December 1982 the government
					attempted to bring the network under its control by stopping private trading and
					creating two cooperatives. One was primarily responsible for bovine trade, the
					other for pigs. At the center of these cooperatives were the merchants who
					previously had engaged in animal trade full time but who were now required to
					invest their funds in the cooperatives. The Vientiane Provincial Government
					Trading Society set the farm gate price for these cooperatives and the consumer
					price for meat. The cooperatives were disbanded in 1984, and each district was
					asked to set up its own cooperatives with responsibility for trading within its
					district, although there is considerable flexibility in trading across
					districts.</p><p xml:id="am46-178-00724" ocms="592 241 438 253 434 435 432 231" pageEid="am46-178-00562">Cattle trading is an important
					activity among farmers of the muang because of the presence of the abattoir, and
					the turnover of animals had to be high because there was little land in the area
					that could be used to graze permanent herds. The beasts were either traded into
					the area to be sold for meat or first used to plow fields and then sold for
					meat. Peasants at ban Don Dou who live around the abattoir have arrangements
					with state/ private merchant enterprises to graze animals waiting to be killed.
					One peasant said this job was done by his little boy, who at that moment had
					four buffalo in his care. The man and his son were expected to feed the animals

Cattle and buffalo trading was
					also one of the main activities engaged in during slack periods by Thao Boun,
					the director of ban Thana cooperative in 1983. Families wishing to trade had to
					register with the muang for 50 kip, he said, and they could then sell their meat
					in the markets in Vientiane after having them killed. He claimed he traded 30–45
					cattle or buffalo per month, each animal costing between 15,000 and 25,000 kip.
					His costs per animal were a 650-kip turnover tax and a 10-kip health check. Of
					approximately 750,000-kip turnover per month in slack periods he claims he
					netted between 3,000 and 4,000 kip per month, or around 1 percent profit on
					total turnover. This was a healthy supplement to his income from the
					cooperative.</p><p xml:id="am46-178-00733" ocms="407 423 592 231 433" pageEid="am46-178-00725">Access to buffalo traded into
					the muang, combined with the relative shortage of grazing area, explains the
					relatively low levels of buffalo and cattle ownership in the district. Thus only
					36 percent of households owned buffalo (an average 2.8 head per household) and
					only 22 percent of households owned cattle (an average of 3 head per household).
					Thus neither buffalo nor cattle were an important source of social
					differentiation in this area.

					natural economy. In villages closer to urban centers the occupational structure
					is more complex. Tail-lard's survey of ban Hat Kansa in Hatsayfong district
					shows only 40 percent of the households engaged in farming, the rest being
					employed in occupations generated by petty commodity production, commerce, and
					the urban economy and the state. Surveys undertaken since 1975 indicate a growth
					in the proportion of people engaged in farming, compared with Hat Kansa before
					1975, which is probably a consequence of the contraction of the urban economy

					from the camp began to clear the trees and build houses for their families. They

					fifteen kilometers northwest of Vientiane. He and his wife said they had moved
					from their old village because they did not have enough male workers in the
					family and the wife had only one sister in her maternal village. They moved to
					ban Nok because Loong Tha had relatives there who were better off. However, the

					put Loong Tha and his family in the rural wage laborer category, he had in fact
					worked as an assistant at the main hospital in Vientiane for thirty-eight years.
					He was in semiretirement because of illness, a factor that had led to his move
					to ban Nok so he could be nearer the hospital. It was his family's poverty, not
					his occupational status, that had caused other peasants to single him out. His
					lack of land along with his semiretired status placed him in the poorest stratum
					of the village. There were ten members in the family, but only the wife and two
					daughters were able to work. Two teenage sons worked for a rice miller in the
					village in return for food and board. These boys sometimes dropped in to eat and
					more rarely to help the family in the fields. In this example—and in these
					processes—we can begin to see the disintegration of a poor peasant family
					through a mechanism common to Laos and Thailand. Writing of Thailand, where
					forms of debt bondage have been common, Lucien Hanks observed, “The departing
					ones recognize their peripheral position under a given roof, since the most
					dispensable person had to be chosen from among many, yet leaving for a better
					opportunity in another area also signifies a parent's concern for a child's

					and daughters who were the “rural proletarians,” Yet on closer inspection they
					were seen to be sometimes tenant farmers. In the wet season of 1981 the wife had
					rented land from Loong Tha's elder sister, but without the normal concessions
					for relatives—which was undoubtedly why the wife felt the husband's relatives
					had treated them badly, Nang Thong, the elder sister, supplied buffalo, plow,
					and seed and split the crop 50/50—the same percentage that was in force before
					1975. In the dry season of 1981–82 they worked as casual laborers for the
					landowning cooperative in ban Nok and were paid in rice. During the wet season
					of 1982 they worked as wage laborers not only for the same cooperative but for
					anyone who would give them work. During the 1983 dry season they had teamed up
					with a “collective” at ban Don Kha Xay. Overall their returns had been just
					adequate, and Loong Tha still received a monthly allowance of thirty kilograms
					of rice from the hospital. The family earned some cash income from one of their
					three buffalo. Two were females which they did not wish to work because they
					hoped to use them for breeding. Occasionally they earned cash income from
					selling Khao Poon at <highlight rend="italic" xml:id="am46-178-01137">bouns</highlight> (weddings or religious festivals). For an outlay of 12
					kip on a kilo of rice they made 40–50-kip profit, but it was a very irregular
					source of income. The family does not borrow money, and Loong Tha claimed they
					used little cash. Asked why the family had not joined the landless cooperative
					in ban Nok Loong Tha gave a reply that reflected even the poor peasants'
					ambivalence toward this form of agricultural organization. He wanted to be a
					cooperative member and to work elsewhere as well, he said. The cooperative,
					however, had insisted that if his family joined they would have to commit
					themselves entirely or not at all. (It should be noted that he was speaking for
					his wife and daughters, who would in fact have been the real cooperative workers
					had they joined; his wife nodded her assent.) In other words, the cooperative
					structure was perceived by this household as too inflexible. The example of
					Loong Tha shows how difficult it is to crisply delineate a proletarian stratum
					or class in an overwhelmingly peasant economy. The poorest members of rural
					society engage in a great variety of activities that constantly change in
					response to opportunities—according to the season, market situation, or perhaps
					even time of day.</p><p xml:id="am46-178-01138" ocms="136 113 226 224 222 361" pageEid="am46-178-01123">The importance of gathering and

					occupation, and customarily a very young girl learns it from her mother. The
					girl learns how to prepare the spindles and the dyes and then how to spin cotton
					and later perhaps silk. Traditionally, weaving was a purely domestic occupation,
					but much of the weaving practiced in ban Thana and Bo-O resembles the “putting
					out” system of the early stage of manufacture prior to the industrial revolution
					in Europe. For example, Dao, the wife of the accountant at ban Thana
					cooperative, owned five hand looms and employed five young women to work for
					her. Her task was dyeing and pattern design, marketing, and supervision. Her raw
					material, both cotton and silk, came from a Thai trader operating out of Nong
					Khai (his business was made possible by liberalization of trade after December
					1979). He supplied a Lao dealer at Vientiane's “Morning Market,” who then
					distributed the raw material to looms in outlying villages, collected woven
					garments, and paid for them.</p><p xml:id="am46-178-01176" ocms="465 461 113 286 434 435 291" pageEid="am46-178-01161">The lucrativeness of weaving can

					because the weavers themselves calculate their earnings in both currencies. They
					arrange some payment in baht because this allows them to trade goods in from
					Thailand. Dao said she made 2,000–3,000 baht (8,820–13,230 kip) per month in
					1982–83, with the upper range calculated on the assumption that her workshop
					produced only silk sins. For example, a silk sin retailed for 220 baht, making a
					set of twenty worth 4,400 baht. The trader gives her 25 percent of their retail
					value, or 1,100 baht. Out of this she pays the women who work for her 500 baht
					per set, leaving the balance of 600 baht for herself. Each girl or woman can

Thus the workers make about 500
					baht every five weeks when weaving silk sins. Assuming that five sets of sins
					are made every five weeks, this would net 3,000 baht for Dao as owner of the
					workshop. However, they also weave cotton sins, which go mainly to the local
					market and retail at 300 kip (68 baht). These can be done more quickly, and Dao
					nets approximately 1,700 baht, or 7,749 kip, per month. The workshop produces
					both types of sin in response to external demand; therefore, Dao's income varies
					between 2,000 and 3,000 baht per month. Weaving is probably the most significant
					form of petty commodity production in the area and is far more important than
					what goes on in agriculture. It was in this type of manufacture—that in which
					“one capitalist simultaneously employs in one workshop a number of craftsmen who
